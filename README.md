# ArcGIS JavaScript Starter Kit

----
This is a starter kit for [ArcGIS JavaScript](http://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/).

This application builds on multiple smaller modules, focusing on bringing all the little bits together. It's built with nearly pure widgets from various other git repos.

# Note
In order to use the [Print Widget](https://github.com/odoe/esri-print-widget) you will need a valid proxy or use a Print Task from your own ArcGIS Server.

*A work in progress*
